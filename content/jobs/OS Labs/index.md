- Engineered an algorithm to automate the generation of comprehensive GraphQL schemas from relational database inputs, facilitating the developer transition from a traditional RESTful architecture to GraphQL’s efficient single-endpoint design.
- Leveraged React Context API and hooks to manage stateful logic in order to avoid unnecessary re-rendering, decrease error potential by eliminating unnecessary prop-drilling, and enable more declarative code.
- Used React Router to create dynamic, declarative routes within a single page application (SPA), decreasing server calls with client-side routing while displaying multiple page views and measurably improving application load time.
- Applied React Flow for interactive visualization of relational database tables and relationships, generating graphical representations of abstract concepts to facilitate better planning, faster debugging, and optimization across a dev team.
- Integrated Node.js and Express for efficient GraphQL query processing via custom middleware, capitalizing on Node’s non-blocking I/O capabilities to boost API performance and reliability.
